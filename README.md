Paste keywords, URLs, or text to find them on the current tab instantly.

This is an advanced search tool designed for everybody, but mostly SEOs, specially on-page SEO Specialists, Content Writers, etc.

On-Page Content Auditing:
SEOs often need to quickly check if specific keywords, phrases, or URLs are present on a given web page. Manually searching (Ctrl+F) for dozens or hundreds of items is impossible. "Find on Current Page" feature allows an SEO or Content Writer to paste a bulk list of terms (keywords, competitor mentions, specific product names, URLs) and instantly see what's present on the current page and what's missing.

It helps for:

Keyword integration checks: Ensuring target keywords are sufficiently used.
Content gaps: Identifying missing topics or entities.
Competitor analysis: Seeing if competitor names or specific phrases are mentioned.
Compliance checks: Quickly finding sensitive terms or brand guidelines.
2- Efficient Data Cross-Referencing (File Comparison):

SEOs work with data from many sources: keyword research sheets (CSV, XLSX), content outlines (DOCX), old audit reports, crawl data, errors and http status codes, etc. They frequently need to compare a list of items (e.g., from a new crawl) against an existing document (e.g., a "target keywords" list or a "previously fixed issues" log). Manual comparison is a nightmare!

"Compare with File" feature automates this.

An SEO can:

Verify keyword implementation: Paste keywords used in new content and compare them against their master keyword list.
Check for fixed errors: Paste a list of URLs with errors from a new crawl and compare it against an old "fixed errors" spreadsheet to see which ones are truly resolved.
Audit content outlines: Compare a list of required topics/entities against a content brief DOCX to ensure all points are covered.
Identify gaps in new data: Quickly see what's missing from a new data set compared to a comprehensive reference file.
Migrate content: Ensure all content pieces from an old site list are present on the new site's content plan document.
